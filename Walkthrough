The target machine is: 10.129.237.186

First we try to know if the machine is being active by using the command <ping 10.129.237.186>
Then lets check what services are running and what ports are open using the nmap scan: <nmap -sC -sV 10.129.237.186>

After the scan completes, we can easily see that there are 4 ports open and the results are as follows:

PORT     STATE SERVICE      VERSION
135/tcp  open  msrpc        Microsoft Windows RPC
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn  Microsoft Windows netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds Windows Server 2019 Standard 17763 microsoft-ds
1433/tcp open  ms-sql-s     Microsoft SQL Server 2017 14.00.1000.00; RTM

Host script results:
| smb-security-mode: 
|   account_used: guest
|   authentication_level: user
|   challenge_response: supported
|_  message_signing: disabled (dangerous, but default)
| smb2-security-mode:

Task 1: Which TCP port is hosting a database server?

Answer: 1433

Host script results show that there is samba service running on the machine so we can try to exploit null sessions using smbclient

<smbclient -L //10.129.237.186 -N>

This lists the shares as: and we can see that non-Administrative share available is backups

 
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
backups         Disk      
C$              Disk      Default share
IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC


Task 2: What is the name of the non-Administrative share available over SMB?

Answer: backups
